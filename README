Description
-----------

Simple Form is a ready to go contact form. Just the following lines are needed
to have a contact form (including the e-mail):

  class ContactForm < SimpleForm
    subject "My Contact Form"
    recipients "your.email@your.domain.com"
    sender{|c| %{"#{c.name}" <#{c.email}>} }

    attribute :name,        :validate => true
    attribute :email,       :validate => /[^@]+@[^\.]+\.[\w\.\-]+/
    attribute :company_name
    attribute :telephone
    attribute :message,     :validate => true
    attribute :nickname,    :captcha  => true
  end

Then you start a script/console and type:

  c = ContactForm.new(:name => 'José', :email => 'jose@email.com', :message => 'Cool!')
  c.deliver

Check your inbox and the e-mail will be there, with the sent fields.

SimpleForm is tested and compatible with Rails 2.2.x and Rails 2.3.x. It also
supports I18n and error messages, just as an ActiveRecord model does.

Installation
------------

Install Simple Form is very easy. It is stored in GitHub, so just run the following:

   gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
   sudo gem install josevalim-simple_form

If you want it as plugin, just do:

   script/plugin install git://github.com/josevalim/simple_form.git

API Overview
------------

== attributes(*attributes)

Declare your form attributes. All attributes declared here will be appended
to the e-mail, except the ones :captcha is true.

Options:

* :validate - When true, validates the attributes can't be blank.
  When a regexp is given, check if the attribute matches is not blank and
  then if it matches the regexp.

* :attachment - When given, expects a file to be sent and attaches
  it to the e-mail. Don't forget to set your form to multitype.

* :captcha - When true, validates the attributes must be blank.
  This is a simple way to avoid spam and the input should be hidden with CSS.

Examples:

   class ContactForm < SimpleForm
     attributes :name,  :validate => true
     attributes :email, :validate => /[^@]+@[^\.]+\.[\w\.\-]+/
     attributes :message
     attributes :nickname, :captcha => true
   end

   c = ContactForm.new(:nickname => 'not_blank', :email => 'your@email.com', :name => 'José')
   c.valid?  #=> true
   c.spam?   #=> true  (raises an error in development, to remember you to hide it)
   c.deliver #=> false (just delivers if is not a spam and is valid)

   c = ContactForm.new(:email => 'invalid')
   c.valid?               #=> false
   c.errors.inspect       #=> { :name => :blank, :email => :invalid }
   c.errors.full_messages #=> [ "Name can't be blank", "Email is invalid" ]

   c = ContactForm.new(:name => 'José', :email => 'your@email.com')
   # save is an alias to deliver to allow it to work with InheritedResources
   c.save #=> true

== subject(string=nil, &block)

Declares the subject of the contact email. It can be a string or a proc.
As a proc, it receives a simple form instance. When not specified, it defaults
to the class human name.

   subject "My Contact Form"
   subject {|c| "Contacted by #{c.name}"}

== sender(&block)

Declares contact email sender. It can be a string or a proc.
As a proc, it receives a simple form instance. By default is:

   sender{ |c| c.email }

This requires that your SimpleForm object have at least an email attribute.

== headers(hash)

Additional headers to your e-mail.

== recipients(string_or_array)

Who will receive the e-mail. Can be a string or array.

I18n
----

All models, attributes and messages in SimpleForm can be used with localized.
Below is an I18n example file:

  simple_form:
    models:
      contact_form: Formulário de contato
    attributes:
      name: Nome
      email: E-mail
      company_name: Empresa
      telephone: Telefone
      message: Mensagem
    messages:
